   > Normative  approach  of  Economics  attempts  to prescribe  what  ought  to  be  done.  For  this,  we  need  to  use  a  set  of  value judgments

 * Page #25 (Chap-01):
   > Thus,  normative  economics is  based  on  ethical,  moral, philosophical  and  religious  beliefs  of  the  people.

 * Page #26 (Chap-01):
   > As 'micro' means small, Microeconomics deals with economic behaviour of small  entity;  it  may  be  a  consumer  or  a  firm

 * Page #26 (Chap-01):
   > Microeconomics  focuses  on  the  behaviour  of  the Individual actors in the economic framework, i.e., firms, individuals and their interaction  in  the  markets.

 * Page #29 (Chap-01):
   > Next step may be analysis of facts through the process of logical reasoning till  we  arrive  at  conclusion

 * Page #29 (Chap-01):
   > Last  step  is  verification  of  conclusion.  If  the conclusion  confirms  with  the  observed  facts,  the  hypothesis  is  verified. Deductive reasoning can be applied to all economic problems.

 * Page #44 (Chap-02):
   > Marginal  utility  is  the  utility  derived  from  the  last  unit  consumed

 * Page #44 (Chap-02):
   > The law states that as a person consumes more units of a good, the marginal utility with the successive units of consumed good decreases while the total utility increases at a falling rate, if other things remain same.

 * Page #44 (Chap-02):
   > All units of the good are homogeneous. (ii) There is no change in taste during consumption of good. (iii) There is no time gap between consumption of successive units of the good. (iv) Consumer is rational and he will not do anything, which will reduce total utilit

 * Page #46 (Chap-02):
   > A rational human being spends his total income over a broad spectrum of goods in such a way that marginal utility derived from the last unit of each good is equal

 * Page #46 (Chap-02):

 * Page #50 (Chap-02):
   > Indifference  curve  analysis  may  be  used  to  calculate  price elasticity  of  demand  for  the  product  which  has  numerous  close substitutes. It will have large substitution effect.

 * Page #89 (Chap-03):
   > If there is an increase in money supply, it will soon be followed by a fall in the interest rate. The fall in the rate of interest leads to an increase in the investment in the economy which will be followed by an increase in money income of the factors of production. With increased money  incomes,  there  is  an  inevitable  increase  in  the  expenditure  on consumption goods. It will further increase investment and money income of the factors of production. Since the economy is already operating at the level of  full  employment  or  the  output  cannot  be  increased  due  to  some unavoidable  reasons,  an  increase  in  investment  expenditure  will  lead  to demand  inflation.

 * Page #89 (Chap-03):
