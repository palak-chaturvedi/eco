## Highlights

 
   > Normative  approach  of  Economics  attempts  to prescribe  what  ought  to  be  done.  For  this,  we  need  to  use  a  set  of  value judgments

 
   > Thus,  normative  economics is  based  on  ethical,  moral, philosophical  and  religious  beliefs  of  the  people.

 
   > As 'micro' means small, Microeconomics deals with economic behaviour of small  entity;  it  may  be  a  consumer  or  a  firm

 
   > Microeconomics  focuses  on  the  behaviour  of  the Individual actors in the economic framework, i.e., firms, individuals and their interaction  in  the  markets.

 
   > deductive  reasoning  and  indeductive reasoning. In deductive reasoning, new conclusion are deduced from already established fundamental assumptions. First step in deductive reasoning may be formulation of assumption on the basis of facts which are to be analyzed.

 
   > Next step may be analysis of facts through the process of logical reasoning till  we  arrive  at  conclusion

 
   > Last  step  is  verification  of  conclusion.  If  the conclusion  confirms  with  the  observed  facts,  the  hypothesis  is  verified. Deductive reasoning can be applied to all economic problems.

 
   > conclusion  derived  from  deductive  reasoning  has  limited applications

   > Conclusions obtained by this method in one situation may not be applicable to another situation or place.

 
   > In inductive reasoning, we start from the general and arrive at the particular conclusion. First step is collection of data. The data size must be large for a theory  to  be  true.

 
   > Next  step  will  be  placing  the  data  in  usable  form.

 
   > The  next  step  involves  the

 
   > formulation  of  hypotheses  from  the  observed  relationship

 
   > Engineering,  in  general,  is  an  application  of  science,  which  is  used  in development  or  improvement  of  products  and  services,  which  ultimately

   > It  improves  the  efficiency  and  the  productivity,  that means getting same output with less input or more output with same input which is subject matter of Economics.

   > become  more  important  than  ever  before.  The  engineers  need  to  have  indepth understanding of basic technologies as well as its recent development to  cope  with  the  technological  advances,  but  equally  important  is  an understanding  of  economic  theories  to  achieve  break-even  and  maximize

   > Anything, commodity or service, which gives satisfaction to human beings on  consumption  is  called  good.

 
   > Free Goods and Economic Goods

 
   > Capital Goods and Consumer Goods

 
   > Those goods, which help in the production of other goods, are termed capital goods

 
   > Consumer goods are directly consumed by human beings

 
   > Consumer  goods  can  be  further  divided  as  perishable  goods  and  nonperishable  goods.  Perishable  good  has  very  short  shelf  life  as  vegetables, milk,  etc

 
   > Demand  for  Veblen  goods increases as their prices increase

 
   > Transferable Goods and Non-transferable Goods

 
   > Complimentary Goods and Substitute Goods

 
   > Material Goods and Non-material Goods

 
   > Demand for normal goods increases with the increase in income

 
   > demand  for  inferior  goods  decreases with increase in income.

 
   > a  Giffen  good  is  one  which  people  paradoxically consume more as the price rises

 
   > In case of normal good, price elasticity of demand is negative but in case of both inferior goods and Giffen goods, it is positive.

 
   > A  public  good  is  both  non-excludable  and  non-rivalrous  as  no  individuals can be excluded from its use and use by one individual does not reduce its availability for others.

 
   > Utility may be defined as the power of a commodity or a service  to  satisfy  human  need.  It  can  also  be  defined  as  the  satisfaction, which a person derives from the consumption or use of a good

 
   > Marginal  utility  is  the  utility  derived  from  the  last  unit  consumed

 
   > The law states that as a person consumes more units of a good, the marginal utility with the successive units of consumed good decreases while the total utility increases at a falling rate, if other things remain same.

 
   > All units of the good are homogeneous. (ii) There is no change in taste during consumption of good. (iii) There is no time gap between consumption of successive units of the good. (iv) Consumer is rational and he will not do anything, which will reduce total utilit

 
   > A rational human being spends his total income over a broad spectrum of goods in such a way that marginal utility derived from the last unit of each good is equal

 
   > Marginal utility diminishes as the consumer uses successive units of a good.

 
   > Indifference curve is the locus of points which represent combination of two commodities M and N which yields equal satisfaction to the consumer.

 
   > Indifference  curve  is  negatively  sloped  and  convex  to  the  origin.  Two indifference  curves  do  not  cross  and  are  usually  parallel  to  each  other. Indifference  curve  to  the  right  side  refers  to  higher  level  of  satisfaction

 
   > The marginal rate of substitution of M for N (MRSMN) refers to the amount of N that a consumer is willing to forego in order to gain one additional unit of M

 
   > The  budget  constraint  line  shows  the  different  combinations  of  the commodities  that  a  consumer  can  purchase,  given  his  money  income  and prices of the commodities

 
   > A  consumer  is  in  equilibrium  when  his  budget  line  reaches  the  highest

 
   > possible  curve

 
   > Price effect is the impact of change in the price of the commodity M on the consumer's demand and its consumption while keeping the price of commodity N, the consumer's taste and money income constant.

 
   > Price effect = Income effect + Substitution effect

 
   > Indifference  curve  analysis  may  be  used  to  calculate  price elasticity  of  demand  for  the  product  which  has  numerous  close substitutes. It will have large substitution effect.

 
   > Indifference  curve  analysis  may  be  used  to  differentiate goods  as  luxury  and  necessity.  Luxury  goods  will  have  a  strong income effect

 
   > The  concept  may  be  used  to  differentiate  substitute  and complementary goods.

 
   > t means a wish becomes want only if it is supported  by  ability  to  fulfil  it

 
   > Wants  can  be  of  three  types:  necessaries, comforts and luxuries. Necessaries are basic for our existence

 
   > e. It can again be of  three  types  as  necessaries  for  existence,  necessaries  for  efficiency  and conventional  necessities.

 
   > if  a  wish  is  supported  by

 
   > ability to fulfil as well as willingness to fulfil, it becomes demand

 
   > When  price  of  a  product  increases  demand  for  that  product  decreases  and vice versa

 
   > The demand curve has negative slope and the sum total of the demand by all the individuals (or a household) is called market demand

 
   > When price of a good remains same but demand for that good decreases or increases due to change in any other factor, then that is known as 'contraction' or 'expansion' in demand

 
   > n case of Giffen goods, when price falls demand also  falls  and  vice  versa

 
   > f more substitutes of a product are available, the demand will be more elastic.

 
   > multiple  use  effect  also  influences elasticity. If a product has only one use or a very limited number of uses, then the effect of a change in price is relatively limited

 
   > m

 
   > products  with  many  uses  may  have  higher  price elasticity than single use goods

 
   > Price elasticity as a guide for setting prices

 
   > Price elasticity as a guide for shifting tax burden in case of indirect tax

 
   > Discount sales

 
   > If, eY < 0, it is inferior good. eY > 0, it is normal good. eY > 1, it is luxury good, eY < 1, it is necessity good.

 
   > Proportionate  change  in  demand  of  commodity  M  due  to  proportionate change  in  the  price  of  another  commodity  N  is  called  cross  elasticity  of demand.

 
   > If Ed * = + ve, then commodities are substitute

 
   > Ed * = â€“ ve, then commodities are complementary

 
   > * = 0, then commodities are not at all related. Ed

 
   > Supply  of  a  commodity  refers  to  the  various  quantities  of  a commodity,  which  a  seller  is  willing  and  able  to  sell  at  different  prices  in  a given market at a given point of time, if other things remain same

 
   > as  the  price  of  a  commodity  increases,  its supply  also  increases

 
   > as

 
   > Contraction  or  expansion  of  supply  means  a  change  in  quantity  supplied without any change in price. Therefore, a shift in supply curve to the right refers to expansion in supply and shift in supply curve to the left refers to contraction in supply

 
   > Proportionate change in supply due to proportionate change in price is called price elasticity of supply.

 
   > Perishable goods  cannot be  stored for long, so their supply is relatively inelastic.

 
   > durable goods  can  be  stored  for  long,  so  supply  of  these  goods  is  more elastic.

 
   > hances of increasing output: Availability of inputs and at which stage  of return-to-scale,  production is  being carried  out, have important bearing on the elasticity of supply.

 
   > Techniques of production: If the technique of production is less  time  consuming  and  easy,  then  the  supply  will  be  more  elastic.

 
   > production  process,  a  set  of  input  is  transformed  into  a  set  of output.

   > r

 
   > stage  of  increasing  return,  all  three,  i.e.,  Total Product (TP), Average Product (AP) and Marginal Product (MP) increase. TP increases at increasing rate as rate of increase of MP is more than AP. In the stage II, which is a stage of constant return, MP starts declining.

 
   > I. In the stage III, which is a  stage  of  decreasing  return,  MP  becomes  negative  and  still  continuously decreases. TP and AP decline.

 
   > Market is an interface between consumer and producer

 
   > In  this  type  of  market,  supply  is  under  control  of  a  single  producer,  the monopolist.

 
   > So, law of demand and supply does not work freely.

 
   > a monopolist derives super normal profit.

 
   > Monopoly  is  legally  created

 
   > Monopoly status is obtained through patent

 
   > Monopoly  status  is  obtained  through  control  over  raw material supplies.

 
   > Market demand is not enough to accommodate two firms

 
   > Price will be lesser in more elastic market and higher in less elastic market.

 
   > Perfect  competition  is  other  extreme  of  market  structure  where  number  of sellers4is  so  large  that  no  single  firm  can  influence  price.  All  firms  are producing  homogenous  products.

 
   > All  units  are  exactly  identical  to  each  other,  i.e.,  they  are homogeneous goods

 
   > Oligopoly is a market situation where number of producers in the industry is small and produce heterogenous product.

 
   > Oligopoly can be of three types:

 
   > Mobile phone in India is an example of oligopoly

 
   > Cartel If all the member firms of the industry join hands together and make a cartel for selling their products.

 
   > Price war If  a  producer  decreases  price  which  is  reciprocated  by  other  to  attract customer  by  decreasing  their  price  further.

 
   > soft  drike  industry  in India. Price wars can be prevented through strategic price management (with non-aggressive pricing), through under standing of the competion.

 
   > If one producer captures larger share in the market, he will decide the price.

   > (vi) Stability of value:

 
   > value of money lies in its purchasing power

 
   > the  amount  of  goods  and  services,  which one unit of money can purchase is regarded as the value of money

 
   > Index number may be defined as a series of figures by which changes in the size of an economic phenomenon are measured from time to time

 
   > Index number considers the average of the changes in prices of various goods and services. If the index number registers a rise, it is an indication that the general price level has gone up.

 
   > Price index number compares the price  level  at  two  points  of  time.

 
   > Total  money  supply  refers  to  aggregate  amount  of  money  in  circulation,

 
   > which  is  owned  by  public4in  a  country  which  comprises  (i)  notes  and currency money, which is issued by the central government and (ii) demand deposits  (subject  to  withdrawal  by  cheques)  held  by  public  with  the commercial  banks

 
   > Time deposit may be regarded as quasi-money but not full-fledged money. It functions as a store of value but not as mode of payment.

 
   > The  total  money  supply  bears  a  certain  variable  proportion  to  the  national income of the country.

 
   > The state is the most important agency influencing the total money supply

 
   > State treasury, generally, issues notes of small value which constitutes legal tender money and helps to facilitate smaller transactions.

 
   > At the same  time,  state  or  central  government  controls  supply  of  money through fiscal policy.

 
   > The commercial bank creates money through bank deposits. It does not keep its deposits idle but grants loans and advances to the customers.

 
   > The  central  bank,  exercises  central  control  over  the  entire  monetary system of the country. It enjoys a monopoly of note-issue and keep a check  on  credit  creation  by  commercial  banks

 
   > Inflation refers to a monetary phenomenon where price rises due to increase of  money  in  circulation  and  is  not  accompanied  by  such  an  increase  in output.

 
   > In a developed economy, inflation, generally, occurs after stage of full employment. However, in a developing economy, inflation may coexist with under-employment of resources. This may be on account of shortage of capital,  equipment,  inefficient  transport  system,  poor  power  facilities, inappropriate technical know-how, etc.

 
   > nflation  may  be  classified  on  the  basis  of  its  cause  as  (i)  Demand  Pull Inflation and (ii) Supply Push Inflation, or on the basis of rate of inflation as (i)  Creeping  Inflation,  (ii)  Running  Inflation  and  (iii)  Galloping  Inflation  or Hyper Inflation

 
   > D

 
   > Demand Pull Inflation

 
   > If there is an increase in money supply, it will soon be followed by a fall in the interest rate. The fall in the rate of interest leads to an increase in the investment in the economy which will be followed by an increase in money income of the factors of production. With increased money  incomes,  there  is  an  inevitable  increase  in  the  expenditure  on consumption goods. It will further increase investment and money income of the factors of production. Since the economy is already operating at the level of  full  employment  or  the  output  cannot  be  increased  due  to  some unavoidable  reasons,  an  increase  in  investment  expenditure  will  lead  to demand  inflation.

 
   > Cost push inflation is caused by an increase in production cost, which may be due to following three factors: (i) an increase in wages,

 
   > (ii) an increase in profit margin, and (iii) imposition of heavy commodity taxes.

 
   > On the basis of Rate of Inflation When prices increase slowly, without increase in supply of products (up to 03% per annum) it is called creeping inflation. Walking inflation is between 03%  to  09%  per  annum.

 
   > If  the  price rises  at  the  rate  of  10-20  per  cent  per  annum,  it  is  referred  as  'running inflation'. If it exceeds that figure, it may be described as 'galloping inflation'

 
   > Hyperinflation  refers  to  a  situation  where  the  price  rise  at  an  alarming  high rate which is very difficult to measure.

 
   > rate of price  rise  is  above  1000%  per  annum.  In  such  situation,  value  of  national currency reduces almost to zero

 
   > Government takes several monetary and fiscal measures to control inflation.

 
   > To control the demand pull inflation the target is to mop up surplus purchasing power from the hands of the public. Main monetary policy is to increase in the tax rate and decrease in subsidie

 
   > But  cost  push  inflation  cannot  be  easily  controlled  through  monetary  and fiscal measures

 
   > The process or the technique to reverse  the  inflationary  trend  in  prices,  without  creating  unemployment,  is generally known as 'disinflation'. So, it is a situation when inflationary rate decreases  but  does  not  reverse.

 
   > .  Disinflation  is  considered  a  normal  and healthy  part  of  the  business  cycle.  However,  deflation  is  a  situation  where there  is  decrease  in  the  general  price  level  of  goods  and  services.

 
   > Deflation  occurs  when  a  recession  is  so  severe  that  prices  are  reduced  to inspire  demand

 
   > followed  by  periods  of  depression. Business  cycles  are  rhythmic  fluctuations  of  an  economy,  i.e.,  periods  of Industries  are  so prosperity interconnected  that  fluctuations  in  one  will  be  passed  on  to  others.

   > Gradually, pessimism gives way to optimism. There is greater demand for goods and services and consequently, there is increased production.

 
   > (iii) Phase of full employment: The cumulative process of recovery continues till  the  economy  reaches  full  employment.  It  means  all  the  available resources  are  fully  employed.

 
   > (iv) Phase of inflation: Beyond a level of full employment, rise in investment may lead to increased pressure on resources. If any of the resources fails  to  deliver  at  the  existing  price  and  asks  for  higher  money,  it distorts the  cost calculation  and then  management realizes  that they have  over-invested

 
   > (v)  Recession:  The  over-optimism  of  the  boom  gives  way  to  pessimism characterized  by  feeling  of  doubt  and  fear.  Though  the  process  of revival  is  generally  very  gradual  but  crash  of  the  boom  is  always sudden  and  sharp.

   > If there is inflationary trend in the economy, it means that there is more money  in  the  circulation  than  goods  and  services  available.  To  control volume of money in the circulation, the government decides to increase rate of interest on bank loan, which leads to reduction in demand for bank loan and ultimately, decreases volume of money in circulation

 
   > if there is large-scale unemployment in the economy, the government decides to decrease the rate of interest on bank loan, which leads to larger demand for loan  and  advances  and  ultimately  eradicates  unemployment  upto  certain extent

   > National Income refers to total national output or value of a nation's output during a specific period (usually one year). It is an important indicator of a country's level of development. There are three different ways of looking at the  value  of  a  nation's  output,  viz.,  Gross7  National  Product  (GNP),  Gross National Income (GNI) and Gross National Expenditure (GNE).
