## Highlights

 
   > The  point  of  intersection  of  the  supply  curve  and the demand curve is known as the equilibrium point

 
   > At the price corresponding to this point, the quantity of supply is equal to the quantity of demand

 
   > The  shape  of  the  demand  curve  is  influenced  by  the  following  factors: (cid:2) Income  of  the  people (cid:2) Prices  of  related  goods (cid:2) Tastes  of  consumers

 
   > The  shape  of  the  supply  curve  is  affected  by  the  following  factors: (cid:2) Cost  of  the  inputs (cid:2) Technology (cid:2) Weather (cid:2) Prices  of  related  goods

 
   > echnical efficiency

 
   > It  is  the  ratio  of  the  output  to  input  of  a  physical  system

 
   > Technical efficiency (%) = Output Input Ã— 100

 
   > Economic  efficiency  is  the  ratio  of  output  to  input  of  a  business  system

 
   > Economic efficiency is also called 'productivity'

 
   > Cost  can  be  broadly  classified  into  variable  cost  and  overhead  cost.  Variable cost  varies  with  the  volume  of  production  while  overhead  cost  is  fixed, irrespective  of  the  production  volume

 
   > Variable cost can be further classified into direct material cost, direct labour cost,  and  direct  expenses.  The  overhead  cost  can  be  classified  into  factory overhead,  administration  overhead,  selling  overhead,  and  distribution overhead

 
   > Direct  material  costs  are  those  costs  of  materials  that  are  used  to  produce the product. Direct labour cost is the amount of wages paid to the direct labour involved  in  the  production  activities.  Direct  expenses  are  those  expenses  that vary  in  relation  to  the  production  volume,  other  than  the  direct  material  costs and  direct  labour  costs

 
   > Overhead  cost  is  the  aggregate  of  indirect  material  costs,  indirect  labour costs and indirect expenses. Administration overhead includes all the costs that are incurred in administering the business. Selling overhead is the total expense that  is  incurred  in  the  promotional  activities  and  the  expenses  relating  to  sales force.  Distribution  overhead  is  the  total  cost  of  shipping  the  items  from  the factory  site  to  the  customer  sites

 
   > Marginal  cost  of  a  product  is  the  cost  of  producing  an  additional  unit  of  that product

 
   > Marginal revenue of a product is the incremental revenue of selling an additional unit  of  that  product.

 
   > This  is  known  as  the  past  cost  of  an  equipment/asset

 
   > the  purchase  value  of  the  equipment  in  the  past  is known as its sunk cost. The sunk cost should not be considered for any analysis done  from  nowonwards.

 
   > . The amount that is foregone by not investing in the other alternative (Y ) is known as the opportunity cost of the selected alternative (X ). So the opportunity cost of an alternative is the return that will be foregone by not investing the same money  in  another  alternative.

 
   > The  main  objective  of  break-even  analysis  is  to  find  the  cut-off  production volume  from  where  a  firm  will  make  profit.

 
   > The intersection point of the total sales revenue line and the total cost line  is called

 
   > the break-even point.

 
   > The corresponding volume of production on the X-axis is known as the break-even sales quantity. At the intersection point, the total cost is  equal  to  the  total  revenue

 
   > This  point  is  also  called  the  no-loss  or  no-gain situation
